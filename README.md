Automobile & Electric Vehicles - Task 1, focusing on the fundamentals of automobile systems and an introduction to Electric Vehicles (EVs).

Objective and Learning Outcomes:

The task aims to build a strong foundational understanding of:
How conventional automobiles work.
How Electric Vehicles differ from traditional vehicles.
Major automobile systems and EV components.
The transition from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles to EVs.
You will learn core automobile engineering concepts, understand EV architecture and working principles, and compare ICE vehicles and EVs.
Key Automobile and EV Concepts:
Conventional Automobile Systems: Include the Engine, Transmission, Braking, Steering, Suspension, and Electrical systems. An automobile is a self-propelled vehicle using mechanical, electrical, or hybrid power for transport.
Electric Vehicle Components: Major parts are the Battery Pack, Electric Motor, Inverter, Battery Management System (BMS), Charger, and Controller. EVs use electric motors for propulsion, store energy in batteries, and do not require fossil fuels.
Comparison and Trends:
ICE vs. EV Comparison: EVs have zero tailpipe emissions, very low noise, lower maintenance, high efficiency, and low running costs compared to ICE vehicles.
EV Advantages: Environment friendly, lower running cost, reduced maintenance, and quiet operation.
EV Challenges: Charging infrastructure, battery cost, charging time, and range anxiety.
